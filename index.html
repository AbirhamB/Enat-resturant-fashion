<p>Ethiopia is a country located in the northeastern part of Africa, known for its rich cultural heritage and diverse culinary traditions. Ethiopian cuisine is distinct and renowned for its unique flavors, aromatic spices, and communal dining style.</p>

<p>One of the most iconic dishes in Ethiopian cuisine is <b>injera</b>, a sourdough flatbread. Injera serves as the foundation of most Ethiopian meals and is made from fermented teff flour, which gives it a slightly tangy taste. It is often used as a utensil to scoop up various stews and dishes.</p>

<p>Ethiopian cuisine features a variety of stews and curries known as wats. These wats are often made with meat, such as doro wat (spicy chicken stew), sega wat (spicy beef stew), or kai sega wat (spicy lamb stew). Vegetarian options include shiro wat (made from ground lentils or chickpeas) and atkilt wat (a flavorful vegetable stew). These stews are typically cooked with a blend of spices, including berbere, a fiery spice mixture made from dried chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and various aromatic herbs.</p>

<p>Injera and wats are typically accompanied by a spicy chili sauce called awaze and a tangy cottage cheese known as ayib or ibs. Additionally, a traditional Ethiopian spice blend called mitmita is often used to add heat and flavor to dishes.</p>

<p>Ethiopian meals are traditionally served on a large communal platter, with the injera acting as a base and the various stews and dishes placed on top. Sharing food from the same platter is a common practice and is seen as a symbol of togetherness and community.</p>

<p>Overall, Ethiopian cuisine offers a diverse and flavorful culinary experience that reflects the country's cultural heritage and traditions. It is known for its vibrant spices, unique flavors, and the communal nature of its dining style.</p>

        </li>

         <li>Roasting the coffee beans:
            The washed coffee beans are then roasted over an open flame.<br> The beans are continuously stirred and carefully monitored to ensure an even roast.<br> The roasting process releases the distinct aroma of freshly roasted coffee.
            
            </li>

         <li>Grinding the coffee beans:
            After roasting, the coffee beans are ground using a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder.<br> The grinding process produces a fine coffee powder.
            
            </li>

         <li>Preparing the jebena:
            The jebena, a traditional clay pot, is filled with water and placed on hot charcoal or a stove to heat.<br> The water is brought to a boil, creating the ideal temperature for brewing the coffee.
        </li>

         <li>Brewing the coffee:
            The freshly ground coffee is added to the jebena, and the pot is placed over the heat source.<br> The coffee is brewed slowly, allowing the flavors to infuse into the water.<br> The aroma of the brewing coffee fills the room, creating an inviting atmosphere.
            
            </li>

         <li>Pouring and serving the coffee:
            Once the coffee is ready, the host or hostess skillfully pours it into small cups from a height.<br> This pouring technique creates a frothy layer on top known as the "kollo." <br>The coffee is served to guests, often starting with the oldest or most honored guest first.<br> The cups are passed around, and the host or hostess refills them as needed.
            
            </li>

         <li>Enjoying the coffee and socializing:
            The guests savor the rich flavors of Ethiopian coffee while engaging in lively conversations.<br> The coffee ceremony serves as a social gathering, fostering connections and strengthening relationships.<br> It is a time for relaxation, enjoyment, and the sharing of stories and laughter.</b></li>
